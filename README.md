About FoldÂ´n Go
 
Welcome to the Github Repository of Fold n go!
We are a international team of 6 ambitious and passionate students and want to have a positive impact on society:
Our vision ist to enable sustainable and healty last mile mobility for us and generations to come!

 
# Our Journey
We created a solution for healthy, eco-friendly last-mile-traveling, using an innovation process to develope the solution, containing researching, ideating, prototyping and much more.
Especially conducting interviews with members of our target group helped us enormous to understand the pains and needs of them.

These pains and needs led us to our storyboard, featuring our idea.
